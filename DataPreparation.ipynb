    "Flight delay is a costly problem to consumers, airlines, and industrial experts. Delays provoke complaints from passengers, create high costs to airlines, and result in difficulties for airport operations. It is therefore important for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to understand the causes of delay as a means to reduce the total cost that delays can cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Known factors that cause flight delays include weather at the origin airport, congestion at the origin airport, and air traffic management (ATM) decisions such as Ground Delay Programs (GDP). Each component interacts with other components in complex ways, which is why flight delays are an inherently stochastic phenomenon. Simply examining the marginal distributions of such factor does not truly reveal the effects that such factors have or the relationship between any two of such factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will perform a case study of the use of Bayesian networks to model the relationship between different components of aircraft delay and the causal factors that affect delays. Bayesian networks allow us to simultaneously examine multiple components of delay and their relationships in a single analysis, an advantage that the use of Bayesian networks has over linear and nonlinear regression models. Moreover, Bayesian network models provide not only just predictions of future delays that incorporate the interrelationships among causal factors, but also a means of assessing the ultimate influence each causal factors has on arrival delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will examine delays in flight from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) to Philadelphia International Airport (PHL)."

On the other hand, FAA defines __LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY__ as arrival delay due to the ripple effect of an earlier delay at downstream airports is referred to as delay propagation. That is, the two seem to have no direct relationship with one another at all. Therefore, we remove both edges."
